Apollo Studio provides features that help you share your graph with external consumers.


## Public graphs

You can make individual [variants](./org/graphs/#managing-variants) of your graph public. If you do, **anyone with the link** can view the following pages for that variant in Studio:

* Home
* Schema
* Explorer

This enables consumers of your graph to learn about your graph's schema and any special usage information (such as authentication details) that you've documented in [the variant's README](#customizing-a-graphs-homepage). They can also run properly authenticated operations against your graph with the Explorer.

People outside your organization can't view any _other_ pages for a public variant (Fields, Operations, etc.), and they can never view _any_ pages for private variants. New variants always start as private.

### Making a variant public

> **Note:** Only organization members with the [`Org Admin` or `Graph Admin` role](./org/members/) can toggle a variant's visibility.

1. Go to your graph's Settings page and open the Access tab.
2. Under the Variants section, toggle the switch for the variant you want to make public.
3. Confirm your selection.

You can make a public variant private by toggling the switch back.

## Customizing a graph's homepage

When a user opens one of your graph's variants in Apollo Studio, its **homepage** is shown:

Like a typical Git repository's homepage, this page displays a Markdown-based README that you can edit with any content you like.

> **Note:** Only organization members with the [`Org Admin`, `Graph Admin`, or `Contributor` role](./org/members/) can edit a variant's README. If a variant is [protected](./org/graphs/#protected-variants-enterprise-only), `Contributor`s _cannot_ edit its README.

**Each variant has its own README.** If you edit one variant's README, those edits are _not_ applied to your graph's other variants. Among other uses, this enables you to provide different information to external consumers in a [public variant](#making-a-graph-public).

### README shortcodes

The README supports a collection of variables that you can include in its text. These variables are rendered with the correct value for the current variant.
